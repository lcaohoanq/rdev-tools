      "description": "I enjoy shaping ideas into systems that make sense — backend services built with Spring Boot, intuitive interfaces in React, and cloud-ready infrastructure that holds everything together. My experience across frontend, backend, DevOps, and mobile gives me a balanced view of how a product should work as a whole. I'm steadily moving toward a Solution Architect role — focused on clarity, long-term thinking, and building systems that are both elegant and practical. Looking for opportunities in Tokyo where I can grow and shape meaningful technical direction."
